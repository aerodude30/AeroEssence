## What this script does
AeroEssence is the Premiere Rune Essence mining script for Old School Runescape. It quickly and effeciently mines and banks
rune essence by teleporting two and from the essence mine by way of Aubury. AeroEssence uses advanced anti-pattern techniques 
to provide your account with the highest level of security. 

AeroEssence was created because there are several broken, poorly coded, and inefficient scripts on Powerbots SDN. This script changes that. 
AeroEssence is able to **intelligently and consistently** mine rune essence without making a mistake, getting stuck, or endangering 
your account with poor code practices.

AeroEssence is one of the first script on the SDN to integrate Aeroscripts into its code! 
Aeroscripts is a bot viewer, real time analytics engine, and remote controller for your powerbot script.
It allows you to monitor, update, and even command your bot remotely from any computer!

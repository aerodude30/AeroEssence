# AeroEssence
## RSBot Script to mine Rune Essence in East Varrock

##Requirements 
- Completed Rune Mysteries Quest
- A pickaxe (Bronze through Dragon) **that must be** wielded by your character not in your inventory.
- It is recommended that you are either level 12 in combat or have the ability to defend yourself against a combat level 6 Mugger who can attack your player on the way to teleport to the Rune Stones.
- **Must be run if fixed mode** 
- Script can be started at any point in the Rune essence mining process and will pick up right where you left off (in varrock west bank, upstairs varrock west bank, by the rune essence rock, in Aubury's hut, with or without essence in your inventory etc...)

##Features
- **Misclick correction** (if script misclicks and you end up upstairs in varrock west bank the script will know and travel down the stairs)
- **Doorjam Prevention** if for some reason a player closes the door to Aubury's hut in an attempt to block bots AeroEssence will detect that the door is closed and open it to allow the script to continue!
- **Random event dispatches** i.e. When a random event NPC requests your input the script will dismiss him/her to avoid bans. AerosEssence also knows and interacts with the random NPC if he/she simply wants to talk to you and give you coins/gems/etc rather than an actual random event. 
- **Comprehensive Anti-Pattern** to avoid detection including but not limited to (Exp Checking, Examining random objects, changing the pitch of the camera and checking random tabs)
- Easy to use and **informative paint** with exp gained, status of the script, exp/hour and even revenue earned! 
- **Shoo's away stray dogs** which provides an anti-pattern feature and prevents the script from getting stuck on pesky stray dogs! 
- **Intelligently position camera** to the object or npc you are interacting with.
- **Support for Bronze through Dragon** pickaxes!

Coming soon! 
- **Aeroscripts compatible** see below!

## What this script does
AeroEssence is the Premiere Rune Essence mining script for Old School Runescape. It quickly and effeciently mines and banks
rune essence by teleporting two and from the essence mine by way of Aubury. AeroEssence uses advanced anti-pattern techniques 
to provide your account with the highest level of security. 

AeroEssence was created because there are several broken, poorly coded, and inefficient scripts on Powerbots SDN. This script changes that. 
AeroEssence is able to **intelligently and consistently** mine rune essence without making a mistake, getting stuck, or endangering 
your account with poor code practices.

AeroEssence will be one of the first script on the SDN to integrate Aeroscripts into its code! 
Aeroscripts is a bot viewer, real time analytics engine, and remote controller for your powerbot script.
It allows you to monitor, update, and even command your bot remotely from any computer!

##FAQ
- "Will this script eventually be able to runecraft?"  Yes, currently there is no support for runecrafting but it is a feature that is under development
- "Why do I have to wield my pickaxe?" It gives you an extra slot for another rune essence/and also provides an extra slot for stuff that random events give you
